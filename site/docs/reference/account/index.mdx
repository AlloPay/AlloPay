# Account

A smart-contract wallet on the [zkSync 2.0 network](https://zksync.io/)

- **Works wherever a regular Ethereum wallet does** thanks to [account abstraction](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/developer-guides/aa.html)
- Has a unique Ethereum address (0x...)
- Can receive and send funds
- Can call other smart-contracts
- Completely self-custodial

## Policies

An account is comprised of one or more [policies](../policy) - a select group that is required to approve a proposal.

Each policy is authorized to perform a set of operations.

## Activating

As all accounts are smart-contracts, they require to be activated (deployed) before they can be used.  
**Accounts will be actived when they reach a minimum balance of $5** of one of the following tokens: ETH, USDC, or DAI.

:::info TESTNET
Accounts are activated on creation

## Deleting

Smart-contracts on zkSync are immutable, so it is not possible to delete an account.  
However, it is possible to withdraw all funds from an account and remove all policies to make it unusable.
