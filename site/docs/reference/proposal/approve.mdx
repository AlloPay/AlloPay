# Approving a Proposal

Only members of the proposal policy can approve it.

## Signing

Obtain your `signature` by signing the [Proposal](../schema/objects/transaction-proposal)'s `id` ([EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) typed-data hash).

```typescript title="Ethers"
const signature = ethers.utils.joinSignature(wallet._signingKey().signDigest(proposal.id));
```

## Execution

Once all members of the policy have approved the proposal it will be executed.

It is recommended that you [subscribe to the proposal](./subscribe) if you need the execution response.
