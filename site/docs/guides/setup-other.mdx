# 🏗️ Setup (other)

<!--
**What you'll need**

- A GraphQL client. We recommend [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started).
-->

Initialize the Zallo client

```http title="Our GraphQL endpoint"
https://api.zallo.io/graphql
```

## Authenticating your requests

// TODO: obtain token

Add the token to your request headers

```
Authorization: $token
```

## 🎉 That's it! You're ready to go

Test that your client is configured correctly by running the following query

```graphql
query DeviceId {
  device {
    id
  }
}
```
