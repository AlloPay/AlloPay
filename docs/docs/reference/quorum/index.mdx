# Quorum

A set of apporvers that are required to approve a proposal.

Quorums are identified by their `key`.

## States

Upon creation the quorums state will be pending (inactive; see [creating a quorum](./create)).  
Activating a state will supercede any previously active state.

### `activeState`

The most recently activated state.  
**Proposals will be executed according to this state.** A quorum without an active state can't execute proposals.

### `pendingStates`

Inactive states with pending proposals.  
**A pending state is activated by [executing the proposal](../proposal#lifecycle)**
