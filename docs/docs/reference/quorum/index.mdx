# Quorum

A set of apporvers that are required to approve a proposal.

Quorums are identified by their `key`.

## States

Quorums must be activated before they can be used (see [creating a quorum](./create)).

### `activeState`

The active state of the quorum is the most recently activated state.  
Proposals will be executed according to this state.

### `pendingStates`

[Executing](../proposal#lifecycle) a pending state create/update proposal will active the state - replacing the prior active state.
