# Creating an account

## Activating

As all accounts are smart-contracts, they require to be activated (deployed) before they can be used.  
**Accounts will be actived when they reach a minimum balance of $5** of one of the following tokens: ETH, USDC, or DAI.

:::info TESTNET
Accounts are activated on creation

## Deleting

Smart-contracts on zkSync are immutable, so it is not possible to delete an account.  
However, it is possible to withdraw all funds from an account and remove all quorums to make it unusable.

## Playground

<CreateAccountExplorer />
