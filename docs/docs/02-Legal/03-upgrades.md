# Upgrade Policy

**Last Updated: July 19, 2024**

At Zallo Labs Pty Ltd ("Zallo Labs", "we", "us", or "our") we prioritize the security and functionality of your account. 
Our Upgrade Policy ensures that your account remains up-to-date while respecting your choices.

Upgrades may impact any of our Services, including but not limited to our website (https://zallo.io), its subdomains, and our app.
By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the Upgrade Policy.


## 1. Automatic upgrades

When a new version is released, we implement an automatic upgrade process for your account. Here's what you need to know:

- Upgrades are scheduled to occur **7 days** after a new release
- During this 7-day period, you have the option to cancel the scheduled upgrade
- Cancelling an upgrade will also opt you out of future automatic upgrades

## 2. Opting-out

We understand that some users may prefer more control over their account upgrades. Therefore, we provide the following opt-out options:

### 2.1. Cancel a scheduled upgrade

During the 7-day period before an automatic upgrade, you can cancel the upgrade through the app interface.

### 2.2. Opt-out of all future automatic upgrades

You can choose to opt-out of all future automatic upgrades at any time. To do this:
- Go to your account settings
- Locate the "Automatic upgrades" item
- Long-press on this item to opt-out of future automatic upgrades

## 3. Important considerations

While we respect your choice to opt-out of an upgrade, or all future automatic upgrades, please be aware of the following:

- Opting out may eventually lead to compatibility issues with the Zallo app
- You may become unable to use your account within our app if you fall behind on upgrades beyond the 7-day period
- Even if you opt-out, we will continue to notify you of new upgrades
- You can always *manually* upgrade your account if you choose to do so later

## 4. Staying informed

Regardless of your upgrade preferences, we are committed to keeping you informed about new releases and important upgrades. You will continue to receive notifications about new versions and their features, allowing you to make informed decisions about your account.

We will also keep you informed about any changes to the Upgrade Policy on our website or app.

## 5. Changes to the Upgrade Policy

You will be notified of any changes to the Upgrade Policy on our website or app.
By continuing to use our Services after changes to the Upgrade Policy, you accept the revised terms.

## 6. Contact information
